  Your terminal allows you to navigate through the folders of your computer and create new directories, too. This can be really handy when managing the code files you'll be creating, editing and saving in this workshop.

  If you want to create a new folder, you can run `mkdir`, the command for **m** a **k** ing **dir** ectories, followed by the name you'd like to have for that particular folder as a parameter:


  ```
  mkdir my-new-folder
  ```

  This will create an empty folder right where you are in your directory structure. To see what's inside the folder, you can navigate into it and list its content. To do so, you can run the command for navigation as follows:

  ```
  cd my-new-folder
  ```

  And to list the content of the folder, you can run:

  ```
  ls
  ```

  You can also go "back up one level" by using the special case `..` (which always refers to "the folder one level up")

  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```

  Go ahead and try it:

  - Create a new folder called `ember-workshop` with terminal commands
  - Navigate into your newly created folder using the terminal
  - List the folder's content. What do you see in your shell window?


  Did you also know that you can copy-paste any of the commands from this tutorial into your terminal window? Hit Control + C (Windows + Linux) or Cmd + C (Mac) while highlighting the command to copy it and use Control + V (or Cmd + V on Mac) while focussing your terminal window to paste it. This is especially useful for long commands that might take a while to type out.
