notes: |
  There are lots of different web browsers that you can choose from

  - chrome
  - Firefox
  - Safari
  - Even Edge or Internet Explorer

  For this workshop we will be doing more than just looking at the websites that you're creating, we will also be using what is called **Developer Tools** on the browser. For that reason we all need to install Chrome.

  Who doesn't have Chrome installed? (hands up)

  You can either search for Chrome or you can install it using the link on step 2 in the training buddy app
