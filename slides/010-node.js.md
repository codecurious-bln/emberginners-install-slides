  Node is a JavaScript runtime. We will go into more details about what JavaScript is exactly tomorrow but for now we just need to install it because it will be used to build our Ember app tomorrow!

  Node comes with a thing called `npm` which helps us to install useful libraries for the application we're building. `npm` used to stand for `Node Package Manager` but now the makers of npm say that it doesn't stand for anything... which is a bit strange ðŸ˜‚

  The install instructions for Node are on step 8 of the training buddy app.

  When it's installed we can verify that it is there (and what version we have installed) by running `node -v` (that's node space hyphen (or minus) lower case v). You will see what this looks like on the training buddy example
