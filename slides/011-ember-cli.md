  Now that we have node and npm installed we can install ember-cli (yay!)

  ember-cli is the the command line tool we'll be using to run and manage our Ember app

  You can see the steps that you need to run in your terminal on the training buddy app `Step 9 - Ember`

  Firstly we will need to install ember-cli globally using npm

  once this is done we will use our newly installed `ember` command to create an ember app for us. If you try to use `ember new` and it doesn't work because it says something like "cannot find program ember" just raise your hand and someone will come over to help you. This is another "PATH" issue ðŸ™ˆ
