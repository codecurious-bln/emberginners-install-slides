  There is a program you can run to "knock on the door" of a website and check if it's currently online. The program is called **ping**. This program has a simple terminal command that you can use to run it, also called `ping` and it can be run in your terminal window by typing `ping` followed by the domain name of the website you want to knock on the door of.

  In this case you don't use http:// or anything in front of the website name

  The `ping` command takes in a url which can be different anytime the program is run and is free to user choice. A text or number that is used in combination with a command is called a **parameter**. During the workshop we will learn about more commands that take in parameters for running their respective program.

  if ping is going on forever in your terminal (it will be different for some of you depending on if you're on windows) then you can run `Control - c` to cancel.

  you can see these command on step 5 of the training buddy app
