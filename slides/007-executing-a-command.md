  There is a program you can run to "knock on the door" of a website and check if it's currently online. The program is called **ping**. This program has a simple terminal command that you can use to run it, also called `ping` and it can be run in your terminal window by typing `ping` followed by the domain name of the website you want to knock on the door of.

  In this case you don't use http:// or anything in front of the website name

  The `ping` command takes in a url which can be different anytime the program is run and is free to user choice. A text or number that is used in combination with a command is called a **parameter**. During the workshop we will learn about more commands that take in parameters for running their respective program.
