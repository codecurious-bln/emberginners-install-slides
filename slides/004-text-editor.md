  To be able to write our first web application we need to install a text editor that allows us to edit our program. In the scope for this workshop we will use **Atom** which is a free text editor that's well suited for development, too.

  As you explore web development you may hear people tell you that one editor is better than another, you might even hear "Editor Wars" from time to time.

  It really doesn't matter what you use, just as long as it helps you build cool things on the web. Atom is a good editor to get started with (especially if you're new) and both myself and Chris use it as our full-time editor
