  The next step is to install Git!

  Who here knows what git is? üôã‚Äç

  Ok so git is a bit of a strange tool to explain but it is super useful and once you get the hang of it you will really learn to love it (like I do üòÇ)

  Git is a **Version Control System** that allows you to keep track of changes to your files. It also happens to be a "**Distributed** Version Control System" which just allows us to more easily make changes to some files on our computer and share them with each other. We will be "cloning" (which is just the git word for downloading) a "repository" (which is just the git word for a folder with some files in it) tomorrow, but for now we just need to get it installed.

  Let's go to `Step 7 - Git` on the Training buddy.

  First things first, let's just check if git is installed on your computer already. You can run `git` in your terminal now to see if we can find it. Most of you will likely see "cannot find command git" or something similar. If you don't have it installed you can get it from the git website (which is linked on the training buddy)

  Once you install it then you might need to restart your terminal for it to "find" the git program.

  If anyone is using windows it might ask you if you want to add Git to the "PATH" when installing. SAY YES! üòÇ
