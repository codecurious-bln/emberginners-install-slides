  A terminal is a program that allows you to run, stop and interact with programs on your computer using text-based commands. Other terms that are used to describe a terminal, are "console", "shell" or "command line".

  Each terminal window or terminal tab will open with a new line mentioning your username on your computer, your computer's name followed by an empty line

  Any program that you run via the terminal can be stopped and re-run. To start a program or process you need to type in the respective command and hit enter, to stop a command use Ctrl + C.

  Throughout this workshop we will mention several commands that you need to run in the terminal.
